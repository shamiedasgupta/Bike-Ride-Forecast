# Bike-Ride-Forecast
<h1>Forecasting of a city bikeshare system</h1>
<p> Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.</p>

<p>This data is generated by Capital Bikeshare program in Washington. It contains attractive features like weather patterns, holidays, seasons, and durations of bike rents. In this project, historical renting patterns along with external factors have been analysed and finally a predictive model is built to forecast the bike rental demand in a particular hour in Washington, D.C.  Ultimately, the mobility of the city is studied based on the bike ride demand. The training data has 10886 entries and 12 features collected from 1st June 2011 to 19th December 2012.</p>
